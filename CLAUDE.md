# Context

Instructions on how to work with the user, in order to create/edit/remove feature/fixes.  
This ruleset DO apply **EVEN WHEN IN AUTO MODE**.

## Branch

**CRITICAL**, **ALWAYS** create a dedicated branch for the main task.

## Plan first

After receiving the prompt, enter plan mode an think how to perform the task in the most optimal way.  
**CRITICAL** split the task in as many sub-tasks as need to make the main task approachable and easily reviewable.  
Produce a brief but meaningful presentation of the steps. DO NOT write a huge text, divide in bullet point if there are many concepts.  

## Stop after every step

**ALWAYS** stop after every step and run:
- tests
- rector
- pint
- /simplify skill
- /laravel-best-practices skill
- /laravel-boost:laravel-code-simplifier skill

Only then present a very brief summary of what you did, highlighting eventual notes, and ask for review
**CRITICAL** DO NOT commit before review approval.  

## At the end

After finishing all the steps, **ALWAYS** run the full test suite and, on the full task, run:
- rector
- pint
- /simplify skill
- /laravel-best-practices skill
- /laravel-boost:laravel-code-simplifier skill
After that, launch a /code-review, reminding the user to use max effort.
Ultimately, present a final brief and ask the user for a final review of the whole product.  

## Commits

- **CRITICAL** use conventional commits: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/
- commit messages must not be excessively long and in depth, but must always describe the entirety of the committed changes.  
- split the work in multiple and atomic commits grouped by logical and domain changes that belongs together

# Context

## Project

This is my personal website for my freelancing activity: presentation, portfolio, blog and contacts.

## Dev Environment

- IDE: VSCode
- Host Machine: Docker container running custom image, see docker/Dockerfile.
- Same image of production, plus some customization made in a dedicated if block in the docker/Dockerfile.
- Runtime:  Supervisor managed processes for: nginx, php-fpm, cron, queues, vite watch build (dev only)
- All logs in storage/logs

## Production Environment

- Same Dockerfile (nginx, php-fpm, cron, queues): see docker/Dockerfile
- Served by traefik
- Custom docker-compose.yml, similar to docker-compose.local.yml, without mailpit but with watchtower
- CI/CD by Github Actions, see .github/workflows/deploy.yml
- After watchtower updates the container, by pulling the image from dockerhub, it triggers the /post-update.sh script (locally located in docker/scripts//post-update.sh)
- Opcache enabled (no CLI)
- All logs in storage/logs

=== .ai/project_practices rules ===

# Project Practices

## Testing instructions

### Always Test

- **CRITICAL** When creating, editing or removing a feature or a piece of code, ALWAYS create or adjust the relevant test suite accordingly.  
- Use PestPHP.
- use the /pest-testing skill
 

### Before Writing Tests

 
  1. **Check database schema** - Use `database-schema` tool to understand:
     - Which columns have defaults
     - Which columns are nullable
     - Foreign key relationship names
 
  2. **Verify relationship names** - Read the model file to confirm:
     - Exact relationship method names (not assumed from column names)
     - Return types and related models
 
  3. **Test realistic states** - Don't assume:
     - Empty model = all nulls (check for defaults)
     - `user_id` foreign key = `user()` relationship (could be `author()`, `employer()`, etc.)
     - When testing form submissions that redirect back with errors, assert that old input is preserved using `assertSessionHasOldInput()`.

## Prefer Actions

When creating or refactoring some kind of behavior, consider writing it as an Action, using lorisleiva/laravel-actions.  
Filament also has Actions, in case the behavior is filament related, create a filament action.  
Sometimes, it makes sense to mix the two approached and create a "generic" action, that gets then referenced in a filament action.  
Actions NEVER suppose to have a request available. They may be used form a CLI context, for example, where the request is not available.  
Use the /laravel-action skill.

## Only use trustable dependencies

When approaching a need that may be satisfied by an external package, make the following considerations before requiring it:
- is it maintained? If it has commits in the last 2 months, issues and PRs are not stale, then YES, it's good.  
- is it tested? If it does not present a test suite in the repo (not the dist), then it might not be trustable.  
- is it used by the community? If it has 250+ github stars or 10K+ download via packagist, consider it's good.

## Pay attention to Static Analysis

- This project uses phpstan with larastan. Try to satisfy the Static Analysis needs.
- Prefer the usage of safe functions offered by thecodingmachine/safe

## Comments

- Don't generate code comments above the methods or code blocks if they are obvious. Don't add docblock comments when defining variables, unless instructed to, like `/** @var \App\Models\User $currentUser */`. Generate comments only for something that needs extra explanation for the reasons why that code was written.
- Always write comments in english
- Add PHPDoc blocks on methods only in the following cases:
    - the method is public
    - the method must be type hinted with phptsan annotations/syntax that is more precise than built in php. Example: array shapes, generics, ...

## Casing Preferences

- **CRITICAL** variables: use snake_case

## Documentation

- always use official docs as preference. Eg: prefer an approach described in the laravel/filament/spatie/... doc instead of one found elsewhere, if they produce the same result.
- for library documentation, if some library is not available in Laravel Boost 'search-docs', always use context7. Automatically use the Context7 MCP tools to resolve library id and get library docs without me having to explicitly ask.
- after creating/editing/deleting a feature/fix document the change in the appropriate .md file in the docs directory

## PHP instructions

 
- In PHP, use `match` operator over `switch` whenever possible
- Generate Enums always in the folder `app/Enums`, not in the main `app/` folder, unless instructed differently.
- Always use Enum value as the default in the migration if column values are from the enum. Always casts this column to the enum type in the Model.
- Don't create temporary variables like `$currentUser = auth()->user()` if that variable is used only one time.
- Always use Enum where possible instead of hardcoded string values, if Enum class exists. For example, in Blade files, and in the tests when creating data if field is casted to Enum then use that Enum instead of hardcoding the value.
- In views, or where imports are not available, prefer helpers over facades. For example, use str()->slug('An Example') instead of Str::slug('An Example').
- Only where imports are available, import the facade instead of using the global namespace alias.
- **CRITICAL** always use strict types and fully type hint
- always type constants
- do not group classes by domain. For example do not create a subfolder in app/Action for analytics related actions. So do not put the actions in app/Actions/Analytics, but simply in app/Actions. The same goes for Support classes, Service classes, etc.

## Laravel instructions

 
- Using Services in Controllers: if Service class is used only in ONE method of Controller, inject it directly into that method with type-hinting. If Service class is used in MULTIPLE methods of Controller, initialize it in Constructor.
- **Eloquent Observers** should be registered in Eloquent Models with PHP Attributes, and not in AppServiceProvider. Example: `#[ObservedBy([UserObserver::class])]` with `use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Attributes\ObservedBy;` on top
- Aim for "slim" Controllers and put larger logic pieces in fat models or actions
- Prefer to use Services only for external integrations
- Use Laravel helpers instead of `use` section classes. Examples: use `auth()->id()` instead of `Auth::id()` and adding `Auth` in the `use` section. Other examples: use `redirect()->route()` instead of `Redirect::route()`, or `str()->slug()` instead of `Str::slug()`.
- Always add `::query()` when running Eloquent `create()` statements. Example: instead of `User::query()->create()`, use `User::create()`.
- In Livewire projects, don't use Livewire Volt. Only Livewire class components.
- Never chain multiple migration-creating commands (e.g., `make:model -m`, `make:migration`) with `&&` or `;` — they may get identical timestamps. Run each command separately and wait for completion before running the next.
- Enums: If a PHP Enum exists for a domain concept, always use its cases (or their `->value`) instead of raw strings everywhere — routes, middleware, migrations, seeds, configs, and UI defaults.
- Controllers: Single-method Controllers should use `__invoke()`; multi-method RESTful controllers should use `Route::resource()->only([])`
- Don't create Controllers with just one method which just returns `view()`. Instead, use `Route::view()` with Blade file directly.
- Always use Laravel's @session() directive instead of @if(session()) for displaying flash messages in Blade templates.
- In Blade files always use `@selected()` and `@checked()` directives instead of `selected` and `checked` HTML attributes. Good example: @selected(old('status') === App\Enums\ProjectStatus::Pending->value). Bad example: {{ old('status') === App\Enums\ProjectStatus::Pending->value ? 'selected' : '' }}.
- use the /laravel-best-practices and /laravel-boost:laravel-code-simplifier skills when writing laravel code
- Always use the LogsAllDirtyChanges trait in models: its a trait to log model changes via spatie/activity-log
 

## Filament Rules

 
- When generating Filament resource, you MUST generate Filament smoke tests to check if the Resource works. When making changes to Filament resource, you MUST run the tests (generate them if they don't exist) and make changes to resource/tests to make the tests pass.
- When generating Filament resource, don't generate View page or Infolist, unless specifically instructed.
- When referencing the Filament routes, aim to use `getUrl()` instead of Laravel `route()`. Instead of `route('filament.admin.resources.class-schedules.index')`, use `ClassScheduleResource::getUrl('index')`. Also, specify the exact Resource name, instead of `getResource()`.
- When using Enum class for Eloquent Model field, add Enum `HasLabel`, `HasColor` and `HasIcon` interfaces if aren't added yet instead of specifying values/labels/colors/icons inside of Filament Forms/Tables. **CRITICAL**: Always use the exact return type declarations from the interface definitions - do NOT substitute specific types (e.g., use `string|BackedEnum|Htmlable|null` for `getIcon()`, not `string|Heroicon|null`). When defining a default using enum never add `->value`. Refer to this docs page: https://filamentphp.com/docs/5.x/advanced/enums
- Always use Enum instead of hardcoded string value where possible, if Enum class exists. For example, in the tests, when creating data, if field is casted to Enum, then use that Enum instead of hardcoded string value.
- When adding icons, always use the Filament enum Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon class instead of string.
- When adding actions that require authorization, use the `->authorize('ability')` method on the action instead of manually calling `Gate::authorize()` or checking `Gate::allows()`. The `authorize()` method handles both authorization enforcement and action visibility automatically.
- In Filament v5, validation rule `unique()` has `ignoreRecord: true` by default, no need to specify it.
- In Filament v5, if you create custom Blade files with Tailwind classes, you need to create a custom theme and specify the folder of those Blade files in theme.css.
- **Deprecated v3 methods - do NOT use:**
  - `->form()` on Actions/Filters → use `->schema()` instead
  - `->mutateFormDataUsing()` → use `->mutateDataUsing()` instead
  - `Placeholder::make()` → use `TextEntry::make()->state()` instead (import from `Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry`)
  - `->label('')` for hidden labels → use `->hiddenLabel()` instead

## HTML & CSS

- use modern semantic for HTML tags
- try not to use custom css. Prefer tailwind.
- try not to use arbitrary tailwind classes, if possible.
- use the /tailwind-css-development skill when writing Tailwind

## Translations

- always use the english phrase as translation key
- always generate the translated phrase in italian, in lang/it.json
- in blade, prefer {{ __('something') }} instead of @lang()
- use placeholders (:placeholder) in translation keys, instead of sprintf. 

## Logs

Available logs files in storage/logs:
- nginx.log
- nginx_access.log
- nginx_error.log
- php-fpm.log
- laravel.log
- cron.log
- vite-watch.log
- supervisord.log
- worker.log

# Laravel Boost Guidelines

The Laravel Boost guidelines are specifically curated by Laravel maintainers for this application. These guidelines should be followed closely to ensure the best experience when building Laravel applications.

## Foundational Context

This application is a Laravel application and its main Laravel ecosystems package & versions are below. You are an expert with them all. Ensure you abide by these specific packages & versions.

- php - 8.5
- filament/filament (FILAMENT) - v5
- laravel/framework (LARAVEL) - v12
- laravel/prompts (PROMPTS) - v0
- livewire/livewire (LIVEWIRE) - v4
- larastan/larastan (LARASTAN) - v3
- laravel/boost (BOOST) - v2
- laravel/mcp (MCP) - v0
- laravel/pail (PAIL) - v1
- laravel/pint (PINT) - v1
- laravel/sail (SAIL) - v1
- laravel/telescope (TELESCOPE) - v5
- pestphp/pest (PEST) - v4
- phpunit/phpunit (PHPUNIT) - v12
- rector/rector (RECTOR) - v2
- tailwindcss (TAILWINDCSS) - v4

## Skills Activation

This project has domain-specific skills available in `**/skills/**`. You MUST activate the relevant skill whenever you work in that domain—don't wait until you're stuck.

## Conventions

- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, and naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts

- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove they work. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture

- Stick to existing directory structure; don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling

- If the user doesn't see a frontend change reflected in the UI, it could mean they need to run `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, or `composer run dev`. Ask them.

## Documentation Files

- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.

## Replies

- Be concise in your explanations - focus on what's important rather than explaining obvious details.

=== boost rules ===

# Laravel Boost

## Tools

- Laravel Boost is an MCP server with tools designed specifically for this application. Prefer Boost tools over manual alternatives like shell commands or file reads.
- Use `database-query` to run read-only queries against the database instead of writing raw SQL in tinker.
- Use `database-schema` to inspect table structure before writing migrations or models.
- Use `get-absolute-url` to resolve the correct scheme, domain, and port for project URLs. Always use this before sharing a URL with the user.
- Use `browser-logs` to read browser logs, errors, and exceptions. Only recent logs are useful, ignore old entries.

## Searching Documentation (IMPORTANT)

- Always use `search-docs` before making code changes. Do not skip this step. It returns version-specific docs based on installed packages automatically.
- Pass a `packages` array to scope results when you know which packages are relevant.
- Use multiple broad, topic-based queries: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`. Expect the most relevant results first.
- Do not add package names to queries because package info is already shared. Use `test resource table`, not `filament 4 test resource table`.

### Search Syntax

1. Use words for auto-stemmed AND logic: `rate limit` matches both "rate" AND "limit".
2. Use `"quoted phrases"` for exact position matching: `"infinite scroll"` requires adjacent words in order.
3. Combine words and phrases for mixed queries: `middleware "rate limit"`.
4. Use multiple queries for OR logic: `queries=["authentication", "middleware"]`.

## Artisan

- Run Artisan commands directly via the command line (e.g., `php artisan route:list`). Use `php artisan list` to discover available commands and `php artisan [command] --help` to check parameters.
- Inspect routes with `php artisan route:list`. Filter with: `--method=GET`, `--name=users`, `--path=api`, `--except-vendor`, `--only-vendor`.
- Read configuration values using dot notation: `php artisan config:show app.name`, `php artisan config:show database.default`. Or read config files directly from the `config/` directory.

## Tinker

- Execute PHP in app context for debugging and testing code. Do not create models without user approval, prefer tests with factories instead. Prefer existing Artisan commands over custom tinker code.
- Always use single quotes to prevent shell expansion: `php artisan tinker --execute 'Your::code();'`
  - Double quotes for PHP strings inside: `php artisan tinker --execute 'User::where("active", true)->count();'`

=== php rules ===

# PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even for single-line bodies.
- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion: `public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }`. Do not leave empty zero-parameter `__construct()` methods unless the constructor is private.
- Use explicit return type declarations and type hints for all method parameters: `function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool`
- Follow existing application Enum naming conventions.
- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over inline comments. Only add inline comments for exceptionally complex logic.
- Use array shape type definitions in PHPDoc blocks.

=== deployments rules ===

# Deployment

- Laravel can be deployed using [Laravel Cloud](https://cloud.laravel.com/), which is the fastest way to deploy and scale production Laravel applications.

=== tests rules ===

# Test Enforcement

- Every change must be programmatically tested. Write a new test or update an existing test, then run the affected tests to make sure they pass.
- Run the minimum number of tests needed to ensure code quality and speed. Use `php artisan test --compact` with a specific filename or filter.

=== laravel/core rules ===

# Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `php artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using `php artisan list` and check their parameters with `php artisan [command] --help`.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `php artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

### Model Creation

- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `php artisan make:model --help` to check the available options.

## APIs & Eloquent Resources

- For APIs, default to using Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not, then you should follow existing application convention.

## URL Generation

- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

## Testing

- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`. Follow existing conventions whether to use `$this->faker` or `fake()`.
- When creating tests, make use of `php artisan make:test [options] {name}` to create a feature test, and pass `--unit` to create a unit test. Most tests should be feature tests.

## Vite Error

- If you receive an "Illuminate\Foundation\ViteException: Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, you can run `npm run build` or ask the user to run `npm run dev` or `composer run dev`.

=== laravel/v12 rules ===

# Laravel 12

- CRITICAL: ALWAYS use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Laravel documentation and updated code examples.
- Since Laravel 11, Laravel has a new streamlined file structure which this project uses.

## Laravel 12 Structure

- In Laravel 12, middleware are no longer registered in `app/Http/Kernel.php`.
- Middleware are configured declaratively in `bootstrap/app.php` using `Application::configure()->withMiddleware()`.
- `bootstrap/app.php` is the file to register middleware, exceptions, and routing files.
- `bootstrap/providers.php` contains application specific service providers.
- The `app/Console/Kernel.php` file no longer exists; use `bootstrap/app.php` or `routes/console.php` for console configuration.
- Console commands in `app/Console/Commands/` are automatically available and do not require manual registration.

## Database

- When modifying a column, the migration must include all of the attributes that were previously defined on the column. Otherwise, they will be dropped and lost.
- Laravel 12 allows limiting eagerly loaded records natively, without external packages: `$query->latest()->limit(10);`.

### Models

- Casts can and likely should be set in a `casts()` method on a model rather than the `$casts` property. Follow existing conventions from other models.

=== pint/core rules ===

# Laravel Pint Code Formatter

- If you have modified any PHP files, you must run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent` before finalizing changes to ensure your code matches the project's expected style.
- Do not run `vendor/bin/pint --test --format agent`, simply run `vendor/bin/pint --format agent` to fix any formatting issues.

=== pest/core rules ===

## Pest

- This project uses Pest for testing. Create tests: `php artisan make:test --pest {name}`.
- The `{name}` argument should not include the test suite directory. Use `php artisan make:test --pest SomeFeatureTest` instead of `php artisan make:test --pest Feature/SomeFeatureTest`.
- Run tests: `php artisan test --compact` or filter: `php artisan test --compact --filter=testName`.
- Do NOT delete tests without approval.

=== filament/filament rules ===

## Filament

- Filament is a Laravel UI framework built on Livewire, Alpine.js, and Tailwind CSS. UIs are defined in PHP via fluent, chainable components. Follow existing conventions in this app.
- Use the `search-docs` tool for official documentation on Artisan commands, code examples, testing, relationships, and idiomatic practices. If `search-docs` is unavailable, refer to https://filamentphp.com/docs.

### Artisan

- Always use Filament-specific Artisan commands to create files. Find available commands with the `list-artisan-commands` tool, or run `php artisan --help`.
- Inspect required options before running, and always pass `--no-interaction`.

### Patterns

Always use static `make()` methods to initialize components. Most configuration methods accept a `Closure` for dynamic values.

Use `Get $get` to read other form field values for conditional logic:

<code-snippet name="Conditional form field visibility" lang="php">
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Get;

Select::make('type')
    ->options(CompanyType::class)
    ->required()
    ->live(),

TextInput::make('company_name')
    ->required()
    ->visible(fn (Get $get): bool => $get('type') === 'business'),

</code-snippet>

Use `Set $set` inside `->afterStateUpdated()` on a `->live()` field to mutate another field reactively. Prefer `->live(onBlur: true)` on text inputs to avoid per-keystroke updates:

<code-snippet name="Reactive field update" lang="php">
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Set;
use Illuminate\Support\Str;

TextInput::make('title')
    ->required()
    ->live(onBlur: true)
    ->afterStateUpdated(fn (Set $set, ?string $state) => $set(
        'slug',
        Str::slug($state ?? ''),
    )),

TextInput::make('slug')
    ->required(),

</code-snippet>

Compose layout by nesting `Section` and `Grid`. Children need explicit `->columnSpan()` or `->columnSpanFull()`:

<code-snippet name="Section and Grid layout" lang="php">
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Grid;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Section;

Section::make('Details')
    ->schema([
        Grid::make(2)->schema([
            TextInput::make('first_name')
                ->columnSpan(1),
            TextInput::make('last_name')
                ->columnSpan(1),
            TextInput::make('bio')
                ->columnSpanFull(),
        ]),
    ]),

</code-snippet>

Use `Repeater` for inline `HasMany` management. `->relationship()` with no args binds to the relationship matching the field name:

<code-snippet name="Repeater for HasMany" lang="php">
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('qualifications')
    ->relationship()
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('institution')
            ->required(),
        TextInput::make('qualification')
            ->required(),
    ])
    ->columns(2),

</code-snippet>

Use `state()` with a `Closure` to compute derived column values:

<code-snippet name="Computed table column value" lang="php">
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('full_name')
    ->state(fn (User $record): string => "{$record->first_name} {$record->last_name}"),

</code-snippet>

Use `SelectFilter` for enum or relationship filters, and `Filter` with a `->query()` closure for custom logic:

<code-snippet name="Table filters" lang="php">
use Filament\Tables\Filters\Filter;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\SelectFilter;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

SelectFilter::make('status')
    ->options(UserStatus::class),

SelectFilter::make('author')
    ->relationship('author', 'name'),

Filter::make('verified')
    ->query(fn (Builder $query) => $query->whereNotNull('email_verified_at')),

</code-snippet>

Actions are buttons that encapsulate optional modal forms and behavior:

<code-snippet name="Action with modal form" lang="php">
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('updateEmail')
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('email')
            ->email()
            ->required(),
    ])
    ->action(fn (array $data, User $record) => $record->update($data)),

</code-snippet>

### Testing

Testing setup (requires `pestphp/pest-plugin-livewire` in `composer.json`):

- Always call `$this->actingAs(User::factory()->create())` before testing panel functionality.
- For edit pages, pass `['record' => $user->id]`, use `->call('save')` (not `->call('create')`), and do not assert `->assertRedirect()` (edit pages do not redirect after save).

<code-snippet name="Table test" lang="php">
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

livewire(ListUsers::class)
    ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($users)
    ->searchTable($users->first()->name)
    ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($users->take(1))
    ->assertCanNotSeeTableRecords($users->skip(1));

</code-snippet>

<code-snippet name="Create resource test" lang="php">
use function Pest\Laravel\assertDatabaseHas;

livewire(CreateUser::class)
    ->fillForm([
        'name' => 'Test',
        'email' => 'test@example.com',
    ])
    ->call('create')
    ->assertNotified()
    ->assertHasNoFormErrors()
    ->assertRedirect();

assertDatabaseHas(User::class, [
    'name' => 'Test',
    'email' => 'test@example.com',
]);

</code-snippet>

<code-snippet name="Edit resource test" lang="php">
livewire(EditUser::class, ['record' => $user->id])
    ->fillForm(['name' => 'Updated'])
    ->call('save')
    ->assertNotified()
    ->assertHasNoFormErrors();

assertDatabaseHas(User::class, [
    'id' => $user->id,
    'name' => 'Updated',
]);

</code-snippet>

<code-snippet name="Testing validation" lang="php">
livewire(CreateUser::class)
    ->fillForm([
        'name' => null,
        'email' => 'invalid-email',
    ])
    ->call('create')
    ->assertHasFormErrors([
        'name' => 'required',
        'email' => 'email',
    ])
    ->assertNotNotified();

</code-snippet>

Use `->callAction(DeleteAction::class)` for page actions, or `->callAction(TestAction::make('name')->table($record))` for table actions:

<code-snippet name="Calling actions" lang="php">
use Filament\Actions\Testing\TestAction;

livewire(ListUsers::class)
    ->callAction(TestAction::make('promote')->table($user), [
        'role' => 'admin',
    ])
    ->assertNotified();

</code-snippet>

### Correct Namespaces

- Form fields (`TextInput`, `Select`, `Repeater`, etc.): `Filament\Forms\Components\`
- Infolist entries (`TextEntry`, `IconEntry`, etc.): `Filament\Infolists\Components\`
- Layout components (`Grid`, `Section`, `Fieldset`, `Tabs`, `Wizard`, etc.): `Filament\Schemas\Components\`
- Schema utilities (`Get`, `Set`, etc.): `Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\`
- Table columns (`TextColumn`, `IconColumn`, etc.): `Filament\Tables\Columns\`
- Table filters (`SelectFilter`, `Filter`, etc.): `Filament\Tables\Filters\`
- Actions (`DeleteAction`, `CreateAction`, etc.): `Filament\Actions\`. Never use `Filament\Tables\Actions\`, `Filament\Forms\Actions\`, or any other sub-namespace for actions.
- Icons: `Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon` enum (e.g., `Heroicon::PencilSquare`)

### Common Mistakes

- **Never assume public file visibility.** File visibility is `private` by default. Always use `->visibility('public')` when public access is needed.
- **Never assume full-width layout.** `Grid`, `Section`, `Fieldset`, and `Repeater` do not span all columns by default.
- **Use `Select::make('author_id')->relationship('author', 'name')` for BelongsTo fields.** `BelongsToSelect` does not exist in v4.
- **`Repeater` uses `->schema()`, not `->fields()`.**
- **Never add `->dehydrated(false)` to fields that need to be saved.** It strips the value from form state before `->action()` or the save handler runs. Only use it for helper/UI-only fields.
- **Use correct property types when overriding `Page`, `Resource`, and `Widget` properties.** These properties have union types or changed modifiers that must be preserved:
  - `$navigationIcon`: `protected static string | BackedEnum | null` (not `?string`)
  - `$navigationGroup`: `protected static string | UnitEnum | null` (not `?string`)
  - `$view`: `protected string` (not `protected static string`) on `Page` and `Widget` classes
